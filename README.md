# 1. "AGB时序分析论文解读.pdf"
This paper takes the English article titled "Inter- and intra-year forest change detection and monitoring of aboveground biomass dynamics using Sentinel-2 and Landsat" as its research subject, focusing on analyzing temporal forest changes and aboveground biomass dynamics.

The authors include Flavy Pelletier, Jeffrey A. Cardille, etc., affiliated with the Department of Natural Resource Sciences at McGill University and the Canadian Forest Service of Natural Resources Canada (Pacific Forestry Centre). The core of the paper is the development of the "Tracking Intra- and Inter-annual Changes (TIIC)" algorithm, which utilizes Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite data to achieve near real-time monitoring of forest changes across Canadian forest ecozones. It can detect forest cover changes and attribute them to disturbance types such as wildfires or mechanical harvesting. Additionally, by integrating forest biomass maps, it quantifies the aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics in 2019. The results show that despite disturbances, Canadian forests achieved an annual AGB increase of 2.54%.

In terms of data and methodology, the study covers twelve forest-dominated ecozones in Canada, using surface reflectance data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B, as well as aboveground biomass data, land cover data, etc. The analysis is conducted through steps such as assembling image collections, change detection, and change type classification using the TIIC algorithm, followed by accuracy assessment. The research results present the forest changes in Canada in 2019 and the dynamics of AGB, discussing aspects such as data fusion and near real-time monitoring capabilities. Finally, conclusions and limitations of the TIIC algorithm in forest change monitoring are drawn.Furthermore, the paper also compiles similar studies, offering understanding, critique, and outlook on the topic. It highlights the research significance, core ideas, and techniques, analyzes issues such as the simplification of growth increment estimation, and provides prospects for future research directions.

# 2. “AIoT—The Internet of Things in the Age of AI.pdf”
# 2. “AIoT——AI 时代下的物联网.pdf”

This article focuses on the concept of AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things), exploring the development and transformation of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the era of artificial intelligence.
本文聚焦于 AIoT（人工智能物联网）这一概念，探讨了在 AI 时代下物联网的发展与变革。

The article first introduces the rise of AI, the development history of IoT, and the concept of AIoT. AI originated in 1956, and after several ups and downs, it has flourished in the era of large models, profoundly changing people's lives. The concept of IoT was proposed in 1999. Although it has developed steadily, it faces challenges such as security, cost efficiency, and others. AIoT is the product of the integration of AI and IoT, with IoT as the network foundation and AI as the technical support, and it does not have a specific time or event of proposal.
文章首先介绍了 AI 的兴盛、物联网的发展历程以及 AIoT 的概念。AI 起源于 1956 年，历经多次起伏后，在大模型时代迎来蓬勃发展，深刻改变人们生活；物联网概念于 1999 年提出，虽发展稳定但面临安全性、成本效率等挑战；而 AIoT 是 AI 与物联网融合的产物，以 IoT 为网络基础，以 AI 为技术支持，并无明确的提出时间和事件。

Next, the article analyzes the upgrade of the AIoT architecture from the perspectives of edge, fog, and cloud. Intelligent edge, based on the perception layer, achieves data compactification and autonomous operations through lightweight AI algorithms. Intelligent fog corresponds to the upgrade of the network layer, using AI to cope with complex architectures and dual pressures, assisting in decision-making and security maintenance. Intelligent cloud further decentralizes on the basis of the traditional application layer, retaining advantages such as elastic scheduling, and also requires AI assistance to complete resource allocation and anomaly handling. In the future, the three will move towards integrated development, promoting the transformation of IoT architecture from original data transmission and centralized control to AI-processed streamlined data and distributed intelligent control.
接着，文章从边缘、雾和云的角度解析了 AIoT 架构的升级。智能边缘在感知层基础上，通过轻量级 AI 算法实现数据紧凑化处理和自主化操作；智能雾对应网络层升级，借助 AI 应对复杂架构和双重压力，辅助决策与安全维护；智能云在传统应用层基础上进一步去中心化，保留弹性调度等优势，还需 AI 辅助完成资源调配和异常处理。未来，三者将走向融合发展，推动物联网架构从原始数据传输、中心化控制向 AI 处理精简数据、分布式智能控制转变。

Then, the article discusses the applications of traditional AI and the new XAI in IoT. Traditional AI covers various methods such as fully supervised learning and unsupervised learning, and is widely used in IoT but has problems like the "black box issue" and hyperparameter tuning. XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) can solve these limitations, help quantify model correctness, and has begun to be applied in multiple IoT fields.
然后，文章探讨了传统 AI 和新型 XAI 在物联网中的应用。传统 AI 涵盖全监督学习、无监督学习等多种方法，在物联网中应用广泛但存在 “黑匣子问题” 和超参数调节问题；XAI（可解释人工智能）能解决这些局限，有助于量化模型正确性等，已开始在多个物联网领域应用。

In addition, the article also introduces important research examples of AIoT, such as using machine learning for IoT anomaly attack detection, utilizing autonomous computing for automatic updates of IoT systems, and employing federated learning for distributed AI updates in IoT systems.
此外，文章还介绍了 AIoT 的重要研究实例，如使用机器学习进行物联网异常攻击检测、利用自主计算实现物联网系统自动更新、利用联邦学习实现物联网系统分布式 AI 更新等。

Finally, the article analyzes the future of AIoT, pointing out its transformation in IoT architecture innovation and AI technology advancement, while also facing challenges such as imperfect XAI models, insufficient hardware performance, and data security and privacy. However, it also brings opportunities for digital transformation in multiple industries.
最后，文章分析了 AIoT 的未来，指出其在物联网架构创新和 AI 技术进步上的变革，同时面临 XAI 模型不完善、硬件性能不足、数据安全隐私等挑战，但也为多个行业带来数字化转型机遇。

Through the study of this article, I have gained a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of AIoT. At the knowledge level, I systematically learned about the development history of AI and IoT, clarified the concept and architecture upgrade of AIoT, as well as the applications of related AI technologies in IoT, and mastered the characteristics and development trends of key technologies such as edge computing, fog computing, and cloud computing.

In terms of capability improvement, I have developed the ability to sort out and analyze complex technical concepts, and learned to examine the current status and future direction of technology development from multiple perspectives. At the same time, by studying the challenges and opportunities faced by AIoT, I have enhanced my forward-looking thinking on technology development, and realized the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and industry cooperation in promoting technological progress.
在能力提升方面，培养了对复杂技术概念的梳理和分析能力，学会了从多个角度审视技术的发展现状与未来方向。同时，通过研究 AIoT 面临的挑战与机遇，增强了对技术发展的前瞻性思考，认识到跨学科合作和行业协作在推动技术进步中的重要性。
