The authors include Flavy Pelletier, Jeffrey A. Cardille, etc., affiliated with the Department of Natural Resource Sciences at McGill University and the Canadian Forest Service of Natural Resources Canada (Pacific Forestry Centre). The core of the paper is the development of the "Tracking Intra- and Inter-annual Changes (TIIC)" algorithm, which utilizes Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite data to achieve near real-time monitoring of forest changes across Canadian forest ecozones. It can detect forest cover changes and attribute them to disturbance types such as wildfires or mechanical harvesting. Additionally, by integrating forest biomass maps, it quantifies the aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics in 2019. The results show that despite disturbances, Canadian forests achieved an annual AGB increase of 2.54%.

In terms of data and methodology, the study covers twelve forest-dominated ecozones in Canada, using surface reflectance data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B, as well as aboveground biomass data, land cover data, etc. The analysis is conducted through steps such as assembling image collections, change detection, and change type classification using the TIIC algorithm, followed by accuracy assessment. The research results present the forest changes in Canada in 2019 and the dynamics of AGB, discussing aspects such as data fusion and near real-time monitoring capabilities. Finally, conclusions and limitations of the TIIC algorithm in forest change monitoring are drawn.Furthermore, the paper also compiles similar studies, offering understanding, critique, and outlook on the topic. It highlights the research significance, core ideas, and techniques, analyzes issues such as the simplification of growth increment estimation, and provides prospects for future research directions.

# 2. “AIoT—The Internet of Things in the Age of AI.pdf”
# 2. “AIoT——AI 时代下的物联网.pdf”

This article focuses on the concept of AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things), exploring the development and transformation of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the era of artificial intelligence.
本文聚焦于 AIoT（人工智能物联网）这一概念，探讨了在 AI 时代下物联网的发展与变革。

The article first introduces the rise of AI, the development history of IoT, and the concept of AIoT. AI originated in 1956, and after several ups and downs, it has flourished in the era of large models, profoundly changing people's lives. The concept of IoT was proposed in 1999. Although it has developed steadily, it faces challenges such as security, cost efficiency, and others. AIoT is the product of the integration of AI and IoT, with IoT as the network foundation and AI as the technical support, and it does not have a specific time or event of proposal.
文章首先介绍了 AI 的兴盛、物联网的发展历程以及 AIoT 的概念。AI 起源于 1956 年，历经多次起伏后，在大模型时代迎来蓬勃发展，深刻改变人们生活；物联网概念于 1999 年提出，虽发展稳定但面临安全性、成本效率等挑战；而 AIoT 是 AI 与物联网融合的产物，以 IoT 为网络基础，以 AI 为技术支持，并无明确的提出时间和事件。

Next, the article analyzes the upgrade of the AIoT architecture from the perspectives of edge, fog, and cloud. Intelligent edge, based on the perception layer, achieves data compactification and autonomous operations through lightweight AI algorithms. Intelligent fog corresponds to the upgrade of the network layer, using AI to cope with complex architectures and dual pressures, assisting in decision-making and security maintenance. Intelligent cloud further decentralizes on the basis of the traditional application layer, retaining advantages such as elastic scheduling, and also requires AI assistance to complete resource allocation and anomaly handling. In the future, the three will move towards integrated development, promoting the transformation of IoT architecture from original data transmission and centralized control to AI-processed streamlined data and distributed intelligent control.
接着，文章从边缘、雾和云的角度解析了 AIoT 架构的升级。智能边缘在感知层基础上，通过轻量级 AI 算法实现数据紧凑化处理和自主化操作；智能雾对应网络层升级，借助 AI 应对复杂架构和双重压力，辅助决策与安全维护；智能云在传统应用层基础上进一步去中心化，保留弹性调度等优势，还需 AI 辅助完成资源调配和异常处理。未来，三者将走向融合发展，推动物联网架构从原始数据传输、中心化控制向 AI 处理精简数据、分布式智能控制转变。

Then, the article discusses the applications of traditional AI and the new XAI in IoT. Traditional AI covers various methods such as fully supervised learning and unsupervised learning, and is widely used in IoT but has problems like the "black box issue" and hyperparameter tuning. XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) can solve these limitations, help quantify model correctness, and has begun to be applied in multiple IoT fields.
然后，文章探讨了传统 AI 和新型 XAI 在物联网中的应用。传统 AI 涵盖全监督学习、无监督学习等多种方法，在物联网中应用广泛但存在 “黑匣子问题” 和超参数调节问题；XAI（可解释人工智能）能解决这些局限，有助于量化模型正确性等，已开始在多个物联网领域应用。

In addition, the article also introduces important research examples of AIoT, such as using machine learning for IoT anomaly attack detection, utilizing autonomous computing for automatic updates of IoT systems, and employing federated learning for distributed AI updates in IoT systems.
此外，文章还介绍了 AIoT 的重要研究实例，如使用机器学习进行物联网异常攻击检测、利用自主计算实现物联网系统自动更新、利用联邦学习实现物联网系统分布式 AI 更新等。

Finally, the article analyzes the future of AIoT, pointing out its transformation in IoT architecture innovation and AI technology advancement, while also facing challenges such as imperfect XAI models, insufficient hardware performance, and data security and privacy. However, it also brings opportunities for digital transformation in multiple industries.
最后，文章分析了 AIoT 的未来，指出其在物联网架构创新和 AI 技术进步上的变革，同时面临 XAI 模型不完善、硬件性能不足、数据安全隐私等挑战，但也为多个行业带来数字化转型机遇。

Through the study of this article, I have gained a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of AIoT. At the knowledge level, I systematically learned about the development history of AI and IoT, clarified the concept and architecture upgrade of AIoT, as well as the applications of related AI technologies in IoT, and mastered the characteristics and development trends of key technologies such as edge computing, fog computing, and cloud computing.
通过对这篇文章的研究，我对 AIoT 有了全面且深入的认识。在知识层面，系统了解了 AI 和物联网的发展历程，明晰了 AIoT 的概念、架构升级以及相关 AI 技术在物联网中的应用，掌握了边缘计算、雾计算、云计算等关键技术的特点和发展趋势。

In terms of capability improvement, I have developed the ability to sort out and analyze complex technical concepts, and learned to examine the current status and future direction of technology development from multiple perspectives. At the same time, by studying the challenges and opportunities faced by AIoT, I have enhanced my forward-looking thinking on technology development, and realized the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and industry cooperation in promoting technological progress.
在能力提升方面，培养了对复杂技术概念的梳理和分析能力，学会了从多个角度审视技术的发展现状与未来方向。同时，通过研究 AIoT 面临的挑战与机遇，增强了对技术发展的前瞻性思考，认识到跨学科合作和行业协作在推动技术进步中的重要性。

This study has also made me deeply appreciate the great potential of the integration of AI and IoT, laying a solid foundation for future learning and practice in related fields, and inspiring my interest in exploring the application and innovation of AIoT technology.
此次研究也让我深刻体会到 AI 与物联网融合的巨大潜力，为今后在相关领域的学习和实践奠定了坚实基础，激发了对 AIoT 技术应用和创新的探索兴趣。

# 6. “一个小的空间分析案例.pdf”

This paper is an assignment on the spatial statistics and analysis of POIs (Points of Interest) in Shenzhen, exploring the distribution characteristics of POIs in Shenzhen through various spatial analysis methods.
本文是一篇关于深圳市 POI（兴趣点）的空间统计与分析作业，通过多种空间分析方法对深圳市 POI 的分布特征进行了探究。

Firstly, the article presents descriptive distribution maps of POIs, including the distribution map of POIs in Shenzhen's traffic zones, POI kernel density map, three-dimensional POI distribution map, and spatial trend map of POI distribution. These maps were created using tools such as ArcMap and ArcScene. The distribution and kernel density maps show the distribution of POI quantities in different traffic zones, the three-dimensional map intuitively displays the spatial differences in POI distribution, and the spatial trend map reflects the overall trend of POI distribution. The analysis found that the global distribution of POIs in Shenzhen is uneven, with concentrated areas corresponding to traffic zone concentrations. The southwest is a high-value area, the southeast is a low-value area, the north-south difference is smaller than the east-west difference, and the western region is densely distributed while the eastern region is sparse.
首先，文章展示了 POI 描述性分布图，包括深圳市交通小区 POI 分布图、POI 核密度图、POI 分布立体图和 POI 分布空间趋势图。这些图通过 ArcMap 和 ArcScene 等工具制作，其中分布图和核密度图呈现了不同交通小区 POI 数量的分布情况，立体图直观展示了 POI 分布的空间高低差异，空间趋势图则反映了 POI 分布的整体趋势。分析发现，深圳市 POI 全局分布不均衡，集中区与交通小区集中区对应，西南部为高峰区，东南部为低值区，南北差异小于东西差异，西部地区分布密集而东部稀疏。

Secondly, hotspot analysis and comprehensive analysis were conducted, generating a hotspot distribution map of POIs in Shenzhen's traffic zones and the results of a combined analysis of POI quantities. The hotspot analysis further verified the distribution characteristics of POIs, showing small clusters in the northwest and northeast, a medium cluster in the southwest, and a large cluster running north-south in the central-western area. The combined analysis utilized functions such as directional distribution, cluster and outlier analysis, and mean center, finding that the average center of POI density is relatively west of the geographical center. The standard deviation ellipse indicates that the main coverage area is in the west, and the cluster and outlier analysis reveals the distribution of high-value areas, low-value areas, and transition zones.
其次，进行了热点分析和综合分析，生成了深圳市交通小区 POI 热点分布图和 POI 数量组合式分析结果。热点分析进一步验证了 POI 分布特征，显示出西北、东北有小聚集区，西南有中等聚集区，中部偏西有连贯南北的大聚集区；组合式分析运用了方向分布、聚类和异常值分析、平均中心等功能，发现 POI 密度平均中心相对地理中心偏西，标准差椭圆表明主要覆盖区为西部，聚类和异常值分析则揭示了高值区、低值区及变化区的分布.

Then, different attributes of POIs were comprehensively analyzed, including statistical charts of POI attributes in various administrative regions, semivariogram cloud maps, covariance cloud maps, and normal QQ plots. The statistical charts show differences in the quantity and types of POIs across administrative regions, with Bao'an District and Longgang District having a larger number, and transportation facilities and other types dominating. The semivariogram and covariance cloud maps indicate significant spatial correlation in different traffic zones at short to medium scales, with correlation decreasing as distance increases. The normal QQ plot shows that the data as a whole differs significantly from the standard normal distribution and does not exhibit significant randomness.
然后，综合分析了 POI 的不同属性，包括各行政区 POI 点属性统计图、半变异函数云图、协方差云图和正态 QQ 图。统计图显示不同行政区 POI 数量和种类存在差异，宝安区和龙岗区数量较多，交通设施等类型占主导；半变异和协方差云图表明不同交通区在中短尺度上空间相关性显著，随距离增大相关性降低；正态 QQ 图显示数据整体与标准正态分布有较大区别，不具显著随机性。

Finally, the article also mentions other statistical results, such as the average nearest neighbor p-value indicating that the spatial randomness hypothesis can be rejected, the Pearson correlation test showing a high correlation between POI types and point coordinates, and statistical measures such as variance and standard deviation of locationx and locationy.
最后，文章还提及了其他统计量结果，如平均最邻近 p 值表明可拒绝空间随机性假设，Pearson 关系验证显示 POI 种类和点坐标相关度较高，以及 locationx 和 locationy 的方差、标准差等统计量。

By completing this spatial analysis case study, I have significantly improved my skills in spatial analysis methods and tool applications. At the knowledge level, I have mastered various spatial analysis methods such as descriptive analysis of POI distribution, hotspot analysis, cluster and outlier analysis, and understood concepts such as kernel density, standard deviation ellipse, and semivariogram and their roles in spatial analysis. I have clarified how these methods can be used to reveal the spatial distribution characteristics and patterns of geographical elements.
通过完成这个空间分析案例，我在空间分析方法和工具应用方面有了显著提升。在知识层面，掌握了 POI 分布的描述性分析、热点分析、聚类和异常值分析等多种空间分析方法，了解了核密度、标准差椭圆、半变异函数等概念及其在空间分析中的作用，明确了如何通过这些方法揭示地理要素的空间分布特征和规律。

In terms of tool usage, I have become proficient in using software such as ArcMap, ArcScene, and MATLAB for data processing, map creation, and statistical analysis. I have improved my operational ability with spatial analysis tools and learned how to select appropriate tools and methods based on research needs to process and analyze data.
在工具使用上，熟练运用了 ArcMap、ArcScene 和 matlab 等软件进行数据处理、地图制作和统计分析，提升了对空间分析工具的操作能力，学会了根据研究需求选择合适的工具和方法来处理和分析数据。

At the same time, through the analysis of POI distribution in Shenzhen, I have developed a spatial thinking perspective, improved my ability to interpret geographical data, and learned to extract effective information from charts and conduct reasonable analysis. This practice has also made me realize the importance of spatial analysis in fields such as urban planning and resource distribution research, laying a solid foundation for future related research and applications.
同时，通过对深圳市 POI 分布的分析，培养了从空间角度思考问题的思维，提高了对地理数据的解读能力，能够从图表中提取有效信息并进行合理分析。此次实践也让我认识到空间分析在城市规划、资源分布研究等领域的重要性，为今后开展相关研究和应用奠定了坚实基础。

# 7. "Different Interchange Structures.pdf"
# 7. "不同的立交结构.pdf"

This article focuses on different types of interchange structures, using several typical interchanges in Shenzhen as examples to provide a detailed introduction to their general situations and structural conditions.
本文聚焦于不同类型的立交结构，以深圳市多个典型立交为例，详细介绍了其概况与结构情况。

Trumpet + Oblique Cloverleaf Interchange (Honghu Interchange): Composed of Nigang East Road and Buxin Road (east-west urban expressways) and Honghu West Road and Wenjin North Road (north-south urban arterial roads). Due to the presence of Honghu Park, dense buildings, and other factors in the surrounding area, space needs to be compressed. Additionally, the road alignment is not orthogonal, and traffic volume is high. Therefore, an oblique cloverleaf interchange model is adopted. A trumpet interchange is also constructed in the southwest for connection. Independent ramps are set on both sides of the road to facilitate vehicles merging in and out without affecting through traffic.
喇叭型 + 斜向苜蓿叶式立交（洪湖立交）：由泥岗东路、布心路（东西向城市快速路）和洪湖西路、文锦北路（南北向城市主干路）组成。因周边有洪湖公园、密集建筑等，需压缩空间，且道路走向非正交、交通流量大，故采用斜向苜蓿叶立交模式，西南部还建设喇叭型立交衔接，道路两侧设有独立匝道方便车辆汇入驶出而不影响直行。

Partial Cloverleaf Interchange (Tangtou Interchange): Involves the Nanguang Expressway (northwest-southeast direction) and the Shenhai Expressway (east-west direction), both of which are expressways. The Nanguang Expressway carries a large volume of traffic, and its alignment is offset to bypass the Tiegang Reservoir. Farmland on the northeast and southwest sides limits space. Therefore, a partial cloverleaf interchange is adopted, with cloverleaves arranged in the northwest and southeast, and non-directional designs on the other two sides. Toll stations are located on the interchange, and their placement alleviates potential congestion.
半苜蓿叶式立交（塘头立交）：涉及南光高速（西北 - 东南方向）和沈海高速（东西方向），均为高速公路。南光高速承接大量车流且走向因绕开铁岗水库发生偏移，东北和西南侧有农田限制空间，因此采用半苜蓿叶式立交，西北和东南处布设苜蓿叶，另外两侧非定向设计，立交上设有收费站且位置缓和了潜在拥堵。

Fully Directional Interchange (Pingdi Interchange): Composed of the Changshen Expressway (north-south direction) and the Shenzhen Outer Ring Expressway (east-west direction), both of which are expressways. Located in a valley opening between two hills, the terrain is restricted. The surrounding roads are complex, buildings are dense, and traffic volume is high. A fully directional model is adopted. By increasing the number of vertical layers and using a quasi-circular pattern, land occupation is reduced, and traffic efficiency is improved. All sections are elevated to facilitate passage on the roads below.
全定向式立交（坪地立交）：由长深高速（南北方向）和深圳外环高速（东西方向）构成，均为高速公路。位于两丘陵间谷地开口，地形受限，周边道路复杂、建筑密集，交通量较大，采用全定向模式，通过增加垂直层数和类环形模式减少占地、提高通行效率，且全部设置高架方便下方路段通行。

Cross Intersection: Ruyi Road (northwest-southeast direction) and Longxiang Avenue (southwest-northeast direction) are both arterial roads located in a bustling area of Longgang District. Surrounding residential and office buildings are dense, making it impossible to adopt an interchange form. Therefore, it is a planar cross intersection with dedicated right-turn lanes. There are conflict points where left-turn routes intersect with other routes.
十字交叉口：如意路（西北 - 东南方向）和龙翔大道（西南 - 东北方向）均为主干路，位于龙岗区繁华地带，周边居民楼、办公楼密集，无法采用立交形式，故为平面十字交叉口，设置专用右转道，存在左转路线与其他路线的交叉冲突点。

Roundabout + Separated Interchange: Yingbin Avenue (east-west direction, including elevated and ground roads) and Yeting Avenue (north-south direction) are both arterial roads. A roundabout is set in the middle, with an overpass above for the east-west road to split and pass, reducing land occupation and allowing east-west through traffic to avoid intersection interference. North-south vehicles can pass directly but cannot handle large traffic volumes.
环岛 + 分离立交：迎宾大道（东西方向，含高架和地面道路）和叶挺大道（南北方向）均为主干路。中间设环岛，上方有高架桥供东西向道路分叉通行，减少占地，使东西向直行车辆不受路口干扰，南北向车辆可直接通行但无法承载大交通流量。

Through the study of different interchange structures, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of urban road interchange design. At the knowledge level, I have learned about the characteristics, applicable scenarios, and design considerations of various interchange structures, such as the impact of traffic volume, terrain, and surrounding environment on choosing the type of interchange. I have also clarified the advantages and limitations of different interchanges in solving traffic intersection problems.
通过对不同立交结构的研究，我对城市道路立交设计有了全面认识。在知识层面，了解了多种立交结构的特点、适用场景及设计考量因素，如交通流量、地形地貌、周边环境等对 choosing 立交类型的影响，明晰了不同立交在解决交通交汇问题上的优势与局限。

In terms of analytical ability, I have learned to interpret the rationality of interchange structure design in conjunction with specific geographical environments and traffic demands, enhancing my understanding of the relationship between spatial layout and traffic organization. At the same time, by comparing different interchange forms, I have developed a multi-angle problem-solving mindset, recognizing that engineering design must balance functionality, economy, and environmental adaptability.
在分析能力上，学会了结合具体地理环境和交通需求去解读立交结构设计的合理性，提升了对空间布局和交通组织关系的理解。同时，通过对比不同立交形式，培养了从多角度分析问题的思维，认识到工程设计需兼顾功能性、经济性和环境适应性。

This study has also made me deeply appreciate the close connection between urban transportation facility design and urban development. It has accumulated practical knowledge for future attention to urban planning and traffic engineering fields and sparked my interest in exploring the optimization of urban transportation systems.
此次研究也让我深刻体会到城市交通设施设计与城市发展的紧密联系，为今后关注城市规划和交通工程领域积累了实践认知，激发了对优化城市交通系统的探索兴趣。
